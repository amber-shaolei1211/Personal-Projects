This project is conducted in the first semester of my sophomore year learning about statistics and R. In this project, we conducted several basic hypothesis tests and data visualizations on determining factors for GDP. We chose log GDP for simplification purposes in order to achieve a linear relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable.
